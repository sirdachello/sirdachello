Basically, it's a tiny prompt game where you need to guess the number within a certain amount of tries. Depending on how close you are, you get certain prompts, if you fail, you start again, if you win, you start again. 
I want to figure out how to add all of that into an HTML+CSS environment now. Want to add voiced narration of events and background image, which, as of now, I have no idea how to do :)
